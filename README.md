# Neighborhood Allies Impact Map

The Neighborhood Allies Impact Map will be used by Neighborhood Allies and affiliated organizations to track the impact and outcomes of grants throughout the city of Pittsburgh. 

# How to Use

Upon opening Impact Map, choose to register a new user, where you will be prompted to create a new organization, and a series of tags for tracking imvenstments.  You will then be taken to the dashboard, which will allow you to log funds that have been received and transferred, as well as view a visualization which tracks the grant funds. 

# Who We Are

Our team came together during the second session of [Academy Pittsburgh](http://www.academypgh.com/), an intensive coding bootcamp. Using the full stack web development skills we attained over the course of twelve weeks, we created this app for [Neighborhood Allies](http://neighborhoodallies.com/), a forward-thinking, solutions-oriented community developer that brings hope, fresh ideas, expertise, and resources to distressed and transitional neighborhoods.

# Development Workflow

We began building the Impact Map over the last two weeks of our session at Academy Pittsburgh: the first week was spent gathering requirements, planning and wireframing; subsequent weeks consist of building and testing the application.
